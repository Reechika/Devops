# Devops-Project-I

In this project we have deployed website app on test server . below is a roadmap to achieve it:
1. Create two ec2 instances
2. Establish master slave architecture between the two 
3. Install ansible on master node
4. Create a jenkins pipeline to install docker ( through ansible) on test server (slave node) and deploy php app on test server.
5. Create a webhook integration between git and jenkins
6. Every time a change is pushed to github , you can see the application deployed on test server.
